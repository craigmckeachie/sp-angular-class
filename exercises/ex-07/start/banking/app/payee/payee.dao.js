/*
 * Create a module, payee.dao, which defines a factory payeeDAO
 *
 * You will move a lot of code from payee.component.js to here
 * Start by moving getPayees() over here, since the DAO will need it
 *
 * The factory itself should return an object with two methods: get and query
 *
 * get
 * Arguments: A payeeId
 * Returns: a single matching payee
 * Grab the code from payee.component.js#getById()
 *
 * query
 * Arguments: A criteria object (a JavaScript object literal of search criteria)
 * Returns: An array of payees who match the search criteria
 * Grab the code from payee.component.js#search
 * (Don't forget that the code includes a dependency on $filter)
 *
