  /*
   * Here in payee-main.component.js, you will add the following code
   *
   * Register a new angular component, 'payee-main.component' with the
   * module 'payee'. Do not create a new module, use the existing one.
   *
   * The component has no dependencies but has a configuration with a
   * template property and a controller property
   *
   * The controller (defined in the revealing module style) should make
   * a variable called 'componentName' available to the view. This variable
   * should be set to the name of the component (i.e., 'payeeMain')
   *
   * The template property should declare, in a header 3, "Welcome to the
   * componentName component" where componentName is the variable defined
   * in the controller, above.
   *
   * When you think you are ready to test your code, open a browser and navigate
   * to http://localhost:8000/banking/
   * and then click on the "Payees" item in the navbar.
